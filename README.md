# DS 110 Final Project: An analysis of RateMyProfessor data

## Paper Introduction
Many college students use RateMyProfessor to determine if a professor’s class is worth taking. In doing this, many students have noticed a phenomenon, being that an oddly high number of reviews talk about a professor’s attractiveness, which is not something that any of us would have considered an important factor. 

We began to wonder if professors who were considered attractive received higher ratings, which led us to ask:  
  
**What features contribute significantly to a RateMyProfessor review?**

Our main goal in this study was to determine the most important factors in a RMP review, and our secondary goal was to determine if attractiveness has any impact on RMP ratings
